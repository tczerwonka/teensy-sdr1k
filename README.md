## T Czerwonka WO9U 2024

Code to allow a Teensy 4.1 via PDF8575 to talk to a
FlexRadio Systems SDR-1000.

Ultimate goal is to interface with something similar to:
[Keith SDR](https://github.com/K7MDL2/KEITHSDR) but without any
SDR-1000 hardware modification.

This code has been a long time in getting to this stage, it will be
a long time getting to anything useful.

If you're just looking for the USB interface to a PC, go here:
